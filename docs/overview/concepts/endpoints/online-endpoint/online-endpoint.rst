Online Endpoints (WIP)
======================

.. note::
    Private preview for this functionality is invite only at this point

Using Online Endpoints users can deploy models for online scoring (also called as realtime scoring).
There are different kind of endpoints that you could create based on the underlying compute that you want to use:

* Managed online endpoints
* AKS endpoints (coming soon)
* Local endpoints (coming soon)

To get started with online endpoints checkout the :ref:`simple-deploy-flow`.
