The ``azure.ml`` package provides user-friendly developer tools for Azure Machine Learning.

It is available via the typical installation tools for each interface, e.g. via `pip` for Python. 

Goals
-----

- consistent job and endpoint stories
- all resources are serializable in a human-readable format
- reduce to fundamental concepts
- jobs are composable
