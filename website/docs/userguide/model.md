## Overview

Models are artifacts generated during a job or uploaded by a user. They contain both the binary artifacts which represent the model as well as instructions on how to use the model to make predictions.

At its simplest, a model is packaged code that takes an input and predicts an output. Creating a machine learning model involves selecting an algorithm and providing it with data. Training is an iterative process that produces a trained model, which encapsulates what the model learned during the training process.	

## Create a Model
Registered models are identified by name and version. Each time you register a model with the same name as an existing one, the registry assumes that it's a new version. The version is incremented, and the new model is registered under the same name.	Models are identified by name and version.

Run the following command to create a model.
```console
az ml model create --file azureml-v2-preview/examples/models/model.yml
```

## What constitutes a model?
Minimum required definition for a model:
```yml
name: my-model
version: 3
asset_path: ./model
```

Full specification of a model:
```yml
name: my-model6
asset_path: ./model
version: 3
environment: azureml:AzureML-Minimal/versions/1
description: this is my test model
tags:
  foo: bar
  abc: 123
